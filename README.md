# Haskell-MOOC-exercises
My solutions to the exercises from the Haskell MOOC from the University of Helsinki: https://haskell.mooc.fi/

All exercises are complete except those in Set14a and Set14b, and the last exercise of Set13b. Also included is an exploration file about the state monad. 

In the course of going through the course, I wrote informal [expository notes](https://ivganev.github.io/machine_learning/files/haskell.pdf).
